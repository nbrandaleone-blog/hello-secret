# hello-secret

This repository holds the code used for the following [blog](https://nicks-playground.net/posts/cloud-run-and-secret-manager-in-clojurescript/). The code has some hard-coded variables, so it will not work "as-is" in another GCP account.

I am working on removing the dependencies, and turning it into a **tutorial** [WIP].
The tutorial will be available by clicking on the button below.  This will launch
a *cloud shell* on GCP.
